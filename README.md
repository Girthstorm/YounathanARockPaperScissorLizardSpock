Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock
Breif description: I made a website where you can play Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock against another player or against a cpu

Peer Review: Nice design! I like the gradient in the background. I like the icons and the gifs that play on the results screen. It's a little annoying clicking through the rules page every time you want to start a game, but the user will certainly be well informed about how to play. The 1 v CPU mode doesn't seem to be working. I also wish you had some sort of way to identify which icon was clicked before clicking the done button to determine the winner. Aside from that, nice work! Your approach with multiple pages works well and your code is really clean and simplistic. Well done!
